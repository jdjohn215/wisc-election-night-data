We are collecting, cleaning, and standardizing ward-level (reporting units, technically) results from counties across Wisconsin. Once a reporting unit is processed, it is added to the table and map below.\nPlease note, these municipalities use a central location to count their absentee ballots. Those results will be added to the appropriate ward totals for each voter. However, the initial ward results shown here may not yet include the central count totals.\nTHIS WEBPAGE CURRENTLY INCLUDES ONLY TEMPLATE DATA–NOT ACTUAL ELECTION RESULTS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElection results in collected reporting units\n\n\nsee map for coverage area.
