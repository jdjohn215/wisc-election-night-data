    "text": "This page shows the current status of our election night data collection. We are collecting, cleaning, and standardizing ward-level (reporting units, technically) results from counties across Wisconsin. Once a reporting unit is processed, it is added to the table and map below.\nPlease note, these municipalities use a central location to count their absentee ballots. Those results will be added to the appropriate ward totals for each voter. However, the initial ward results shown here may not yet include the central count totals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElection results in collected reporting units\n\n\nsee map for coverage area. Absentee ballots may not yet be reflected in the 2024 ward totals.\n\n\n\nTOT\nDEM\nREP\nmarginv\nmarginp\n\n\n\n\nUSS 2024\n2,124,709\n1,084,539\n993,688\n90,851\n4.3 pt.\n\n\nPRE 2024\n2,146,333\n1,085,688\n1,024,388\n61,300\n2.9 pt.\n\n\nPRE 2020\n2,251,599\n1,195,396\n1,017,368\n178,028\n7.9 pt.\n\n\n\nWard boundaries change between elections.
